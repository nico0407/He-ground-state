# Hegroundstate
The aim of this project is to compute the Helium nucleus ground state under an harmonic oscilator potential.
\
The computation was done using two different Monte Carlo integration method, the Variational MonteCarlo method(VMC) and the diffusion Monte Carlo method(DMC).

For time reasons it was left partially incompleated.
